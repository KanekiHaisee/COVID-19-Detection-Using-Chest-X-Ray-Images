# COVID-19-Detection-Using-Chest-X-Ray-Images
This project involves building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras with TensorFlow backend to predict COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The dataset includes X-ray images of both COVID-19 positive and negative patients, sourced from Kaggle. The project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for medical image classification.
